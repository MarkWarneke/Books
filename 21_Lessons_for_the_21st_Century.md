[Home](Readme.md)

Influenced by Bill Gates notes [Best Books 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2018) I bought the book.
Interested by the sucessor "Sapiens - A Brief History of Humandkind" I was very interested in getting my hands onto the latest book by Yuval.
The book strikes again with Yuvals amazing way of explaining the past while pointing out current challanges and giving a notion of the future.
