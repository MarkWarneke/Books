Influenced by Bill Gates notes [Best Books 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2018) I bought the book.
Interested by the sucessor "Sapiens - A Brief History of Humandkind" I was very interested in getting my hands onto the latest book by Yuval.
The book strikes again with Yuvals amazing way of explaining the past while pointing out current challanges and giving a notion of the future.

## Summary

- The world growth closer as the time proceeds
- Computers and machines take over mondane and soficticated work of people, leaving the questions what will happen if no work needs to be done for men?
- Men and machine interaciton, can the humand use the intelligence and correctness of a machine to imporve even further? [Kasparov: "Deep Thinking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhkTHkIZJEc)
- Having freedom of choice and striving liberty is it a advantage or drawback? Can a computer decide better on the outcome of humankind?
- Argumenting age old philosophical questions like the trolly dilemma Yuval points out cirtical limitation of a computer, or are those limitations? Leaving the question will the liberal human decide to benefit his ego or the greater good for all? Leaving the question are people even intrinsically good? 
- Next to the question of humankind the question of complexity comes into play. By using data driven algorithmens only computers can evaluate what can humans decide? 
- When no labor is left to be done how should value be distributed? If people own the machines, should they get a larger share of the cake? 
- Critiziing variaty of religions, pointing out flaws and arguments about the idea and impact of relegious constructus
